The solution depends on the specific cause of the problem. Here are some common fixes:

**1. Check for Conflicting Styles:**
Ensure no other styles are overriding the `filter` property.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's computed styles and look for conflicting properties.

**2. Z-index Issues:**
If the element is overlaid by another, ensure the z-index value is properly set to ensure that the element appears correctly above or below other elements. For example:

```css
#blurred-element {
  z-index: 1;
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```

**3. Parent Element Styles:**
Sometimes, styles on a parent element can affect the rendering of child elements. Check the styles applied to the parent elements of the element you are trying to blur.

**4. Check for Typographical Errors:**
Verify that the CSS filter property is typed correctly and that the blur radius value (e.g., `5px`) is valid.

**5. Verify the Target Element:**
Make sure the selector correctly targets the desired element.  Use your browser's developer tools to check if the CSS is being applied to the correct element.

**Example of Corrected CSS (bugSolution.css):**

```css
#myElement {
  filter: blur(5px);
  z-index: 1; /* added if necessary */
}
```
