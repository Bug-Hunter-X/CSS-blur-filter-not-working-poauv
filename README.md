# CSS Blur Filter Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the CSS `filter: blur()` property fails to produce the expected visual effect. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The CSS blur effect is applied to an element, but the blur is not visible, or only partially applied. This can happen due to several reasons such as conflicting styles, incorrect z-index values, or issues with parent element styles.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully inspecting the CSS styles applied to the element and its ancestors.  It may involve adjusting z-index values to ensure the element is rendered correctly on top or behind other elements.  Additionally, make sure there are no conflicting styles that overwrite the blur effect. Consider checking the specificity of the CSS rules involved.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the lack of blur effect in the initial code and the corrected effect after applying the solution.
